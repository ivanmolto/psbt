[BIP-370](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0370.mediawiki) is a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that introduces version 2 (PSBTv2) of the Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) format. There is no version 1.

This version builds on the original specification (BIP-174) to improve flexibility and functionality for more complex Bitcoin transactions.

Here are the key features of BIP-370:

- Enhanced flexibility.
- Operator roles update.
- Improved malleability.

This proposal advances the PSBT system by making it more adaptable to the evolving needs of Bitcoin transactions.
